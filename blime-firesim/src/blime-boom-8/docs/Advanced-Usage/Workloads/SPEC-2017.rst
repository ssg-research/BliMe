SPEC 2017
---------------------

SPEC2017 support in FireSim is provided through FireMarshal, which
cross-compiles spec using Speckle in Chipyard. Build SPEC2017 in
``<chipyard-dir>/target-software/spec2017``, and then install to FireSim's workload
directory using FireMarshal's `install` command.  See
https://github.com/ucb-bar/spec2017-workload for more detail on the SPEC2017
workload definition.

When using reference inputs, SPEC workloads tend to complete within one to two
days, but this varies strongly as a function of the target microarchitecture,
FPGA frequency, and FMR.
