 * @brief Base class for CPU-managed streams
 *
 * Streams implemented with the CPUManagedStreamEngine have a common set of
 * parameters, and use MMIO to measure FPGA-queue occupancy. This base class
 * captures that.
 *
 * Children of this class implement the host-independent control for streams.
 * Generally, this consists of doing an MMIO read to FPGA-side queue capacity,
 * to determine if a stream request can be served. Host implementations
 * instantiate these classes with callbacks to implement MMIO and either CPU- or
 * FPGA-managed AXI4 for their platform.
