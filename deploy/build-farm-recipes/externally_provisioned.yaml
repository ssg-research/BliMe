# See https://docs.fires.im/en/stable/Advanced-Usage/Manager/Manager-Configuration-Files.html for documentation of all of these params.

# Schema:
###########
#   # Class name of the build farm type.
#   # This can be determined from `deploy/buildtools/buildfarm.py`).
#   build_farm_type: <TYPE NAME>
#   args:
#       # Build farm arguments that are passed to the `BuildFarmHostDispatcher`
#       # object. Determined by looking at `parse_args` function of class.
#       <K/V pairs of args>

# Unmanaged list of build hosts. Assumed that they are pre-setup to run builds.
build_farm_type: ExternallyProvisioned
args:
    # managerinit arg start
    # REQUIRED: (replace this) default location of build directory on build host.
    default_build_dir: null
    # REQUIRED: List of IP addresses (or "localhost"). Each can have an OPTIONAL
    # argument, called "override_build_dir", specifying to override the default
    # build directory.
    #
    # Ex:
    # build_farm_hosts:
    #     # use localhost and don't override the default build dir
    #     - localhost
    #     # use other IP address (don't override default build dir)
    #     - "111.111.1.111"
    #     # use other IP address (override default build dir for this build host)
    #     - "222.222.2.222":
    #         override_build_dir: /scratch/specific-build-host-build-dir
    build_farm_hosts:
        - localhost
    # managerinit arg end
