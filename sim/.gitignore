# We commit this so that the metals plugin is properly configured out of the
# box.  VSCode will modify this on-the-fly if users make workspace settings
# changes. If that becomes a problem (i.e., it happens frequently, and people
# complain about having a dirty tracked file) we can install these defaults
# instead.
